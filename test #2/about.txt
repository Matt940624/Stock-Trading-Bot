This side project is to delve deeper into the realm of algorithms. The algorithm I am exploring in this side project is the simple moving average. 
This strategy is used by many day trading experts in the stock trading market. I will also be testing on a new API that I have recently discovered,
called the Alpaca API. This API should allow me to get stock data fairly easy and make trades within the platform itself. The simple moving average
is a strategy that is calculated by adding the price of an instrument over a number of time periods and then dividing the sum by the number of time 
periods. This is pretty useful when one has the needed data.
