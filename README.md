# Stock-Trading-Bot
This is a personal project.

For this function to do its job, there are a few ways it could be done. The first of which being to host the function on one's own computer as a server and to run the script according to when the market opens in the U.S. This obviously has its advantages and disadvantages. The method that is suggested by me however, takes use of the free trial google developer provides. By signing up to Google Function, one gets three hundred dollars worth of credit, enough for basic use and to host the algorithm on there. To host the function, simply go into the google cloud function and paste the code in. Having done that, remember to add a requirments text on the side to allow the platform to understand what packages you need in the function. Finally, to automate the whole process, utilize the cloud scheduler also at your disposal in google developer to schedule the script to run at the time frame you want it to run. 

Feel free to use this source and to add upon it. Remember to fill in the API keys with keys of your own, and also add your email if you want updates of the trades via mail.
