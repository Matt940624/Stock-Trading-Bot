The purpose of this small test will be to try and host a socket server that gets information from the internet called. "webscraping".
Although this is a Python based project, this small initial test will use some javascript. This project will be grabbing data from a 
website of different foreign exchange rate. To start off this side project, I will need a main execution script. Then, I will need to 
build a webscraping script using javascript. Finally, the data acquired will be sent to my socket server created in another python file. 
When linked together with the main python script, the thing will continiously pull data from the internet and make them into tables and
storing it in the socket server.
