This will be the final algorithm and automation of stock trading bot. I am going to use several of the function I had previously tested out on. 
This would be a blend between the previous simple moving average and the pairs strategy I discovered online. This trading algorithm will have four
parts to it. The first part will be getting the data, this part would be quite easy with the API I am currently using. The second part will be
to process the data, to implement it into a series of formulas to determine the position of stocks. The third part is the algorithm and the logic
itself. This logic will be implemented after a series of trial and error. The final part would be the email notifications. For this entire function
to run without manual operation, it needs some form of communication with me. Using a package should solve this. The endgoal of this function is 
to have it run on Google developer and for it to be acessible to all.
