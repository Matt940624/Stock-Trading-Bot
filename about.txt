This third test is another test on the algorithm strategy of Martingale. Martingale is a strategy of investing in which the dollar value of 
investments continually increases after losses, or the position size increases with the lowering portfolio size. Meaning for every loss one 
increases the stock order by double. This should be an interesting test to my paper account. And this would also show if this is the suitable
strategy according to the complexity of the logic behind it.
